# Problem 2: Word Frequency

## Task

Given a paragraph of text, output the top 3 most frequent words.  
Ignore capitalization and punctuation.


## Example

Input:

```
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
It compiles on my machine,
Why not on you?

I thought I had fixed it,
the logic was sound,
but then came the tests...
and the bugs gathered round.

Code is poetry,
or so they claim,
until a semicolon
breaks the whole game.
```

Output: `["the", "it", "are"]`
