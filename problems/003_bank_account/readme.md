# Problem 3: Simulate a Bank Account

## Task
Implement a `BankAccount` class with `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance`.  
Process a series of transactions and print the final balance.  
Invalid withdrawals (when balance is insufficient) should be counted.

## Example
Transactions: `[("deposit",100), ("withdraw",50), ("withdraw",100)]`  
Output: `Final balance: 50, Invalid withdrawals: 1`
