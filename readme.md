# Coding workouts

This repository contains a small set of **entrylevel programming challenges**, for any
programming languages, yet I am prepared with starter code only for **Python** and
**JavaScript**. The goal is to practice **problem-solving and coding fundamentals**,
not language syntax.

These problems are designed for students with little or no experience, but they require combining multiple concepts,
like loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, classes, etc.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Choose a problem**
   - Problems are listed in the `problems/` folder.
   - Each problem has starter code in both Python and JavaScript.

1. **Solve it in your preferred language**
   - Write your solution directly in the provided starter file.
   - Add test cases if you want to check more inputs.

1. **Submit your solution**
   - Fork this repository.
   - Create a branch for your solution (e.g., `solution-problem1`).
   - Commit your code.
   - Open a Pull Request with a short description of your approach.


## üìö The Problems

All problems are stored in the [./problems](./problems) folder.  
Each problem has starter code in **Python** and **JavaScript**.


## ‚úÖ Goals of These Exercises

- Practice **core programming concepts**: loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, classes, text processing.
- Learn to **structure code** instead of writing one-liners.
- Gain experience with **GitHub workflows**: forks, branches, pull requests.
- Encourage **discussion and peer review** via PR comments.


## üí° Tips

- First, make it work... Only then, make it right.
- Write code that is **clear and readable**.
- Try to handle **edge cases** (empty input, unusual values) after the **happy flows**.
- Comment your thought process if the solution isn‚Äôt obvious.
- Don't worry about efficiency, **focus on correctness and clarity first**.
